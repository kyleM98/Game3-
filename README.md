# Game3-

Welcome

This is a rather simple game i have created which features a character("Grimm") jumping from platform to platform in order to collect all the coins shown on screen.

The character is able to run from left to right(arrow keys), jump(up arrow key) and slash with his sword(spacebar)

To run the game you will need to 'npm install live server'
once this is installed, left click the '<>index.html' and select open with live server.

There were a few things that had been removed from the game as they were not functioning as i had hoped, things such as a title screen, enemies(zombies) and an alert which should display at the end of the game. (These will be added soon though once i figure everything out)
